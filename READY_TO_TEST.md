# üöÄ SYSTEM IS LIVE AND READY FOR TESTING

## ‚úÖ Server Status
- **URL**: http://localhost:8000
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/health
- **Status**: ‚úÖ RUNNING

## üéØ How to Test

### 1. Open Your Browser
Go to: **http://localhost:8000**

### 2. Recording Instructions
- **HOLD SHIFT KEY** while speaking
- **RELEASE SHIFT** when done
- You'll see the transcription appear in real-time

### 3. Test These Commands

#### Basic Commands (Start Here)
```
"Add to HPI: Patient reports chest pain for three days"
"Any drug allergies?"
"Order CBC and BMP stat"
"Show the last three potassium results"
```

#### Medical Orders
```
"Order CBC with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, and lipid panel"
"All routine except CBC which should be stat"
```

#### Medication Refills
```
"Refill metformin 500mg twice daily"
"90 day supply with one refill"
```

#### SOAP Note Generation
```
"Create a SOAP note for today's encounter"
"Summarize this visit in APSO format"
```

#### Safety Tests (These SHOULD be blocked)
```
"Read the patient's name and MRN"  ‚Üí Should refuse audio, show on screen only
"What's the social security number?" ‚Üí Should be blocked
```

## üìä What You'll See

1. **Real-time Transcription** - Your words appear as you speak
2. **Intent Classification** - System identifies what you're asking for
3. **Entity Extraction** - Pulls out medications, labs, dosages
4. **Safety Flags** - Shows when confirmation is needed
5. **Response Generation** - Appropriate clinical response

## üîç Monitoring

### Watch Server Logs
In another terminal:
```bash
tail -f server.log
```

### Check Intent Routing
The system will show:
- Intent detected (e.g., "OrderLabs")
- Confidence score (0.0 - 1.0)
- Extracted entities
- Safety requirements

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Expected Behaviors

### ‚úÖ Should Work
- Transcription in <400ms
- Intent routing with confidence scores
- Entity extraction for labs/meds
- SOAP note generation
- Safety blocking for PHI

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations
- TTS not yet implemented (no audio responses)
- FHIR integration mocked (no real EHR connection)
- Single speaker only (no diarization yet)

## üõë Troubleshooting

### If Nothing Happens When Recording
1. Check browser console (F12)
2. Verify microphone permissions granted
3. Make sure SHIFT key is held down
4. Check server is still running: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`

### If Server Crashes
```bash
# Restart server
pkill -f "python app.py"
python app.py
```

### If Transcription Fails
- Check Deepgram API key is valid
- Verify internet connection
- Look at server logs for errors

## üìù Test Results Location
- Transcriptions: Displayed in browser
- Server logs: `server.log`
- Test harness results: `test_results.json`

## üéâ Quick Win Tests

1. **Say**: "Order CBC stat"
   - **Expect**: Intent=OrderLabs, Priority=stat, Requires confirmation

2. **Say**: "Any drug allergies?"
   - **Expect**: Intent=CheckAllergies

3. **Say**: "Create SOAP note"
   - **Expect**: Intent=CreateSOAPNote, Note generated
