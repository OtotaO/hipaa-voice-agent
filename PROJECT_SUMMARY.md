2. **HIPAA Security Layer**
   - PHI redaction system (`src/core/security.py`)
   - Encryption at rest and in transit
   - Comprehensive audit logging
   - Caller verification system

3. **Medical Tools Suite** (`src/tools/medical_tools.py`)
   - Appointment scheduling
   - Lab results checking (with normal/abnormal policies)
   - Prescription refill management
   - Provider messaging system

4. **Durable Workflows** (`src/workflows/temporal_client.py`)
   - Appointment confirmation workflows
   - Refill processing automation
   - Provider message review queues
   - Prior authorization tracking

5. **FHIR Integration** (`src/services/fhir_client.py`)
   - Complete FHIR R4 client
   - Support for Patient, Appointment, Observation, MedicationRequest resources
   - Compatible with Epic, Cerner, and other FHIR-compliant EHRs
