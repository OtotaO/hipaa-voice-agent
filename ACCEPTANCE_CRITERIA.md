# ðŸ“Š ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA: What Actually Matters

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) - Must Pass ALL

### 1. **Core Functionality**
- [ ] Records audio from microphone/headset
- [ ] Transcribes with >90% accuracy on medical terms
- [ ] Generates structured SOAP note in <3 seconds
- [ ] Allows editing before save
- [ ] Exports to clipboard/text

### 2. **Safety**
- [ ] NO medication orders without human review
- [ ] NO direct EHR writes in v1
- [ ] Clear "DRAFT" watermark on all notes
- [ ] Physician must review before using

### 3. **Performance**
- [ ] Transcription latency <500ms per utterance
- [ ] Full note generation <3 seconds
- [ ] Works on 4-year-old laptop
- [ ] Handles 10-minute conversations

### 4. **Reliability**
- [ ] Saves drafts every 30 seconds
- [ ] Recovers from network interruption
- [ ] Never loses a recording
- [ ] Fallback to local storage

### 5. **Compliance**
- [ ] Zero PHI in logs
- [ ] All audio deleted after processing
- [ ] Encrypted storage for drafts
- [ ] Session timeout after 15 min idle

## Success Metrics - Week 1 Pilot

### Time Savings (PRIMARY)
- **Target**: 5 minutes saved per encounter
- **Measure**: Clock time from visit end to note signed
- **Baseline**: 8-10 minutes currently
- **Goal**: <3 minutes with tool

### Quality Scores
- **Completeness**: All SOAP sections filled
- **Accuracy**: <3 corrections needed per note
- **Coding**: Captures primary diagnosis correctly
- **Billing**: Suggests appropriate E&M level

### Physician Satisfaction
- **Would recommend**: >4/5 score
- **Continues using after pilot**: >80%
- **Specific feedback**: "Saves time" mentioned

## What We're NOT Measuring (Yet)

### Not Important for MVP:
- Voice UI quality (using keyboard is fine)
- Multiple speaker detection (doctor only is OK)
- Real-time streaming (batch processing OK)
- EHR integration (copy/paste is OK)
- Mobile app (web only is OK)

## Red Flags - Stop if Any Occur

1. **Takes LONGER than current workflow**
2. **Generates dangerous misinformation**
3. **Loses patient data**
4. **Physician says "This is more work"**
5. **Transcription accuracy <80%**

## Go/No-Go Decision Tree

```
Week 1 Results:
â”œâ”€â”€ Saves >3 min per note?
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ YES â†’ Continue to Week 2
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ NO â†’ Find out why
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Transcription errors? â†’ Fix ASR
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Bad templates? â†’ Revise prompts
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ UI friction? â†’ Simplify workflow
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ Physicians want to keep using?
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ YES â†’ Scale to 10 users
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ NO â†’ Interview and iterate
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ Quality acceptable?
    â”œâ”€â”€ YES â†’ Begin EHR integration planning
    â””â”€â”€ NO â†’ Focus on accuracy first
```

## Honest Success Criteria

### By End of Month 1:
- 5 physicians using daily
- 50+ notes generated
- Average time savings: 4 minutes
- Zero safety incidents
- Physician NPS: >30

### By End of Month 3:
- 25 physicians across 2 clinics
- 1,000+ notes generated
- Direct EHR integration started
- Cost per note: <$0.50
- Physician NPS: >40

### By End of Month 6:
- 100+ physicians
- Epic marketplace listing
- Insurance/billing accuracy >95%
- Proven ROI: $20K+ per physician/year
- Ready for Series A funding

## What Kills This Product

### Technical Killers:
- Transcription WER >15% (unusable)
- Generation takes >5 seconds (too slow)
- Requires $500+ hardware (too expensive)
- Needs IT installation (friction)

### Clinical Killers:
- Misses critical information
- Suggests wrong codes/billing
- Creates legal liability
- Requires more training than savings

### Business Killers:
- Costs >$200/month per user
- Epic integration takes >1 year
- Compliance blocks deployment
- Physicians won't champion it

## The Bottom Line Test

**Would a burned-out physician finishing clinic at 7 PM choose to use this?**

If yes â†’ We have a product
If no â†’ We have a demo

Current status: **We have a promising prototype that needs 2 weeks of real-world testing to become a product.**

## Next Action Items

1. **Today**: Run test_scenarios.py and fix any failures
2. **Tomorrow**: Demo to 1 physician friend, get brutal feedback
3. **This Week**: Fix top 3 issues, re-demo
4. **Next Week**: 5-day pilot with 3 physicians
5. **Week 3**: Go/No-Go decision based on metrics

Remember: Perfect is the enemy of good. Ship something that saves 5 minutes TODAY, not something that might save 30 minutes SOMEDAY.
