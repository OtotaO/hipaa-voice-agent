## The AI-First Differentiation

### AI Agents You'll Build

#### **1. Claim Scrubber Agent** (Week 1)
- Reviews claims BEFORE submission
- Catches errors: CPT-ICD mismatch, missing auth, wrong modifiers
- **Impact**: Denials drop from 15% â†’ 7% = $20K/year per practice

#### **2. Denial Appeal Agent** (Week 3)
- Auto-generates professional appeal letters
- Uses payer-specific templates + medical necessity language
- **Impact**: Appeal success 60% â†’ 85% = $15K/year per practice

#### **3. Prior Auth Agent** (Week 5)
- Extracts data from clinical notes
- Auto-fills payer forms
- **Impact**: 2 hours per auth â†’ 10 minutes = $30K/year per practice

#### **4. Voice Charge Capture** (Week 6)
- Doctor speaks: "Order CBC, BMP, lipid panel"
- AI converts: [71020, 80048, 80061]
- **Impact**: 5 min â†’ 30 sec per encounter = physicians LOVE it

### Fine-Tuning Loop

**Weeks 1-4: Collect Data**
- 10 practices Ã— 200 claims = 2,000 claims
- ~300 denials (15% rate)
- 100 successful appeals (historical)

**Weeks 5-8: Train Models**
```python
# Claim scrubber trained on clean vs denied claims
# Appeal writer trained on successful appeals
# Models improve weekly as more data comes in
```

**Month 3+: Network Effects**
- More doctors â†’ More data â†’ Better models â†’ More value
- Competitors can't replicate your dataset
- **Defensible moat**

- **AI Coding Assistant**: +$79/month (optimize E&M levels)

**Blended ARPU**: $400/month
**75 practices Ã— $400 = $30K MRR = $360K ARR** (end of year 1)

### Value Proposition
> "We use AI to cut your denials in half and increase collections by 20%.
> That's $4,500 more per month. We charge $199.
> **22X ROI.**"

**No-brainer pricing.**

## Why This Will Work

### 1. **Real Problem, Proven Market**
- 71% of practices use AI already
- $292M VC funding in medical AI (2024)
- Denials cost practices $20K-50K/year
- Doctors are DESPERATE for billing help

### 2. **Network Distribution**
- 300 doctors = built-in customer base
- Family trust = instant credibility
- Word of mouth spreads in medical community
- No CAC (customer acquisition cost) for first 100 customers

### 3. **AI Creates Defensible Moat**
- Fine-tuned models on YOUR network data
- Competitors can't replicate your dataset
- Models improve weekly (network effects)
- 10X faster feature development with AI agents

### 4. **Economics Work**
- $155/month operating cost
- $199/month revenue
- 22% margin ($44/practice)
- 75 practices = $3,300/month profit
- **Scales to $50K+ profit with 1,000 practices**

## What Could Go Wrong (And How to Mitigate)

### Risk 1: "Can't get 10 pilots committed"
**Mitigation**:
- Lower bar to 5 pilots
- Offer $500 cash incentive for first 5
- Extend timeline by 1 week

**Likelihood**: Low (you have family network)

### Risk 2: "AI makes mistakes on claims"
**Mitigation**:
- Human review on HIGH-RISK (surgery, controlled substances)
- AI handles LOW-RISK (office visits, labs)
- Track error rate, pause if >2%

**Likelihood**: Low (Llama 3.2 is very accurate)

### Risk 3: "Can't hit 20% improvement"
**Mitigation**:
- Start with worst practices (high denials = easy wins)
- Even 10% improvement = strong ROI
- Money-back guarantee builds trust

**Likelihood**: Low (AI claim scrubbing alone = 10-15% improvement)

### Risk 4: "Stedi changes pricing or shuts down"
**Mitigation**:
- Abstract clearinghouse behind interface
- Can swap to Waystar/Availity in 1 week
- Not locked into any vendor

**Likelihood**: Low (Stedi is VC-backed, growing)
