    Doctor: Good morning, Mr. Smith. What brings you in today?

    Patient: Hi doctor, I've been having chest pain for the past two days. It's been really concerning me.

    Doctor: I understand your concern. Can you describe the pain? Where exactly is it located?

    Patient: It's in the center of my chest, kind of a pressure feeling. It gets worse when I walk up stairs.

    Doctor: Does the pain radiate anywhere? To your arms, jaw, or back?

    Patient: Sometimes it goes to my left shoulder, yes.

    Doctor: Any shortness of breath, nausea, or sweating with the pain?

    Patient: I do get a bit short of breath when the pain is bad. No nausea though.

    Doctor: Do you have any history of heart problems? High blood pressure, high cholesterol?

    Patient: My cholesterol was a bit high last year. I'm on atorvastatin 20mg daily. My father had a heart attack at 65.

    Doctor: Are you a smoker? Any diabetes?

    Patient: I quit smoking 5 years ago. No diabetes, but I'm probably 30 pounds overweight.

    Doctor: Let me examine you. Your blood pressure is 145 over 90, slightly elevated.
    Heart rate is 88, regular rhythm. I'm hearing a slight murmur on auscultation.
    Your EKG shows some ST segment changes that concern me.

    Given your symptoms, risk factors, and EKG findings, I'm concerned about possible unstable angina.
    We need to admit you for further cardiac workup including troponin levels, stress test, and possibly cardiac catheterization.
    I'm going to start you on aspirin 325mg now, and we'll add a beta blocker for rate control.
    We'll also increase your statin dose.

    Do you have any questions?

    Patient: Will I need surgery?

    Doctor: Let's see what the tests show first. We'll take excellent care of you.
